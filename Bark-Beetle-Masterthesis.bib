abstract = {The main objective of this study was to monitor wet snow conditions from Sentinel-1 over a season, to examine its variation over time by cross-checking wet snow with independent snow and weather estimates, and to study its distribution taking into account terrain characteristics such as elevation, orientation, and slope. One of our motivations was to derive useful representations of daily or seasonal snow changes that would help to easily identify wet snow elevations and determine melt-out days in an area of interest. In this work, a well-known approach in the literature is used to estimate the extent of wet snow cover continuously over a season and an analysis of the influence of complex mountain topography on snow distribution is proposed taking into account altitude, slope, and aspect of the terrain. The Sentinel-1 wet snow extent product was compared with Sentinel-2 snow products for cloud free scenes. We show that while there are good agreements between the two satellite products, differences exist, especially in areas of forests and glaciers where snow is underestimated. This underestimation must be considered alongside the areas of geometric distortion that were excluded from our study. We analysed retrievals at the scale of our study area by examining wet snow Altitude–Orientation diagrams for different classes of slopes and also wet snow Altitude–Time diagrams for different classes of orientations. We have shown that this type of representation is very useful to get an overview of the snow distribution as it allows to identify very easily wet snow lines for different orientations. For an orientation of interest, the Altitude–Time diagrams can be used to track the evolution of snow to locate altitudes and dates of snow loss. We also show that ascending/descending Sentinel-1 image time series are complementary to monitor wet snow over the French alpine areas to highlight wet snow altitude ranges and identify melt-out days. Links have also been made between Sentinel-1 responses (wet snow) and snow/meteorological events carefully listed over the entire 2017–2018 season.},

abstract = {The Copernicus Programme has become the world's largest space data provider, providing complete, free and open access to satellite data, mainly acquired by Sentinel satellites. Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have improved spatial resolution and high revisit frequency, making them useful for a wide range of applications. While few research applications need Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) data with few corrections applied, a wider range of users needs products with a standard set of corrections applied. In order to facilitate the exploitation of Sentinel-1 GRD products, there is the need to standardise procedures to preprocess SAR data to a higher processing level. A standard generic workflow to preprocess Copernicus Sentinel-1 GRD data is presented here. The workflow aims to apply a series of standard corrections, and to apply a precise orbit of acquisition, remove thermal and image border noise, perform radiometric calibration, and apply range Doppler and terrain correction. Additionally, the workflow allows spatially snapping of Sentinel-1 GRD products to Sentinel-2 MSI data grids, in order to promote the use of satellite virtual constellations by means of data fusion techniques. The presented workflow allows the production of a set of preprocessed Sentinel-1 GRD data, offering a benchmark for the development of new products and operational down-streaming services based on consistent Copernicus Sentinel-1 GRD datasets, with the aim of providing reliable information of interest to a wide range of communities.},

abstract = {This paper reports the results of a study of the foliar reflectance properties of lodgepole pine trees under mountain pine beetle attack which aimed to determine the sequence of changes which occur. The motivation for this study was to identify spectral regions showing the earliest signs of attack in order to choose spectral bands for airborne linear array sensors. Normal illumination, diffuse hemispherical reflectance spectra were obtained of needles from trees showing varying degrees of stress from beetle attack and for needles from unattacked trees for comparison. The more pronounced changes in the spectra were interpreted visually and compared to changes reported by other authors. The more subtle changes were studied by analysing variance methods. Three spectral bands (the green peak, red edge and near-infrared (NIR) shoulder regions) have been identified as most promising for detecting early effects of bark beetle attack. Three additional bands (the blue, red and NIR plateau regions) are identified as reference bands for calibration and comparison purposes. The difference between foliar reflectance of attacked and unattacked trees is found to be most significant in the visible and red edge regions for current foliage and in the NIR for previous foliage. A red edge red shift was observed in the spectra of current foliage from attacked trees, in contrast to red edge blue shifts associated with stress in other studies. The observed sequence of subtle to more pronounced changes cannot be explained qualitatively using current knowledge of the plant pigment and anatomical changes which occur at the cellular and needle levels in stressed conifers. Further study of the detailed changes in pigments and cellular and foliar anatomy is recommended, both to elucidate on the cause-and-effect relationships which occur, and to indicate the extent to which this paper's findings can be generalized. The findings suggest that multispectral linear array airborne scanners may be able to detect stressed conifers long before the red attack stage, but further investigation is required to determine whether the differences at foliar level between attacked and unattacked trees can also be detected at the whole-tree level, and whether confusion with other ground cover types can be avoided. {\textcopyright} 1988 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Bond prices are allowed to be either overpriced or underpriced at the purchase time, while at the sale time the bonds are suppose to be fairly priced. Assuming shifts in spot rates to occur instantly after the acquisition of a bond portfolio Z and to follow fairly general type of behavior described by the condition (2), we give both necessary and sufficient conditions for Z to solve the immunization problem above. Our model is general enough to cover situations with twists in the yield curve. Making use of the K-T conditions, we explain in remark 7 why we focus on search of an optimal portfolio in the class of barbell strategies. Finally, by means of the K-T conditions we find an optimal bond portfolio which solves the immunization problem. {\textcopyright} J.C. Baltzer AG, Science Publishers.},

abstract = {A number of studies have linked responses in leaf spectral reflectance, transmittance, or absorptance to physiological stress. A variety of stressors including dehydration, flooding, freezing, ozone, herbicides, competition, disease, insects, and deficiencies in ectomycorrhizal development and N fertilization have been imposed on species ranging from grasses to conifers and deciduous trees. In all cases, the maximum difference in reflectance within the 400-850 nm wavelength range between control and stressed states occurred as a reflectance increase at wavelengths near 700 nm. In studies that included transmittance and absorptance as well as reflectance, maximum differences occurred as increases and decreases, respectively, near 700 nm. This common optical response to stress could be simulated closely by varying the chlorophyll concentration of model leaves (fiberglass filter pads) and by the natural variability in leaf chlorophyll concentrations in senescent leaves of five species. The optical response to stress near 700 nm, as well as corresponding changes in reflectance that occur in the green-yellow spectrum, can be explained by the general tendency of stress to reduce leaf chlorophyll concentration.},

abstract = {Spruce bark beetle outbreaks are common in Norway spruce forests following windstorm damage, due to ample availability of brood material. The realization of an outbreak depends on factors regulating the Ips typographus population dynamics, such as weather conditions and salvage cutting. In this study, we take an ecosystem modelling approach to analyse the influence of multiple environmental factors on the risk for I. typographus outbreaks. Model calculations of I. typographus phenology and population dynamics as a function of weather and brood tree availability were developed and implemented in the LPJ-GUESS ecosystem modelling framework. The model simulations were driven by gridded climate data covering Sweden with a spatial resolution of 0.5° and a daily temporal resolution. Records on storm damage and I. typographus outbreak periods in Sweden for the period of 1960-2009 were used for model evaluation, and a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the model behaviour. The model simulations replicated the observed pattern in outbreak frequency, being more common in southern and central Sweden than in northern Sweden. A warmer climate allowing for more than one generation per year can increase the risk for attacks on living trees. The effect of countermeasures, aiming at either reduce the availability of brood material or the I. typographus population size, is dependent on a non-linear relation between I. typographus attack density and reproductive success. The sensitivity analysis indicated a major reduction in the risk of attacks on living trees by timely salvage cutting and cutting of infested trees. Knowledge uncertainties associated with attacks on standing trees, i.e. factors influencing tree defence capacity and I. typographus reproductive success, should be further addressed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Natural hazards caused by insect outbreaks, such as those induced by the European bark beetle (Ips typographus L.), are among the most extensive disturbances affecting forest health in various geographical regions. Accurate and up-to-date knowledge of the spatial distribution of bark beetle-infested trees is critical for forest managers to effectively plan appropriate countermeasures and predict future bark beetle infestation dynamics. In this study, three scenarios for mapping bark beetle-induced tree mortality based on airborne hyperspectral data (HyMap) were examined including combining a genetic algorithm (GA) for feature selection with a supervised support vector machine (SVM) classification. The scenarios differed in how the mortality classes (used to extract the spectral signatures) were defined. Scenario 1 included three mortality classes, while Scenario 2 and 3 each included only one general mortality-related class but with different definitions. The classes, derived from the three scenarios, served as inputs into feature selection facilitated by the GA. The most stable bands, selected by the GA, were then used as input bands for a bootstrapped supervised SVM classification procedure. In two of the three scenarios, the trained classifier was additionally applied to a second independent hyperspectral image to evaluate the stability of the spectral signatures derived from the training samples. The classification procedure was further refined by varying the number of input bands and the input data types, where the bands not only included the original reflectances of the HyMap images but also a first order Savitzky-Golay derivation and continuum-removed spectra. The results of the study indicate that an accurate differentiation of three mortality classes was not possible with the applied methodology. The defined pre-visual "green mortality stage" class in particular was found to be heavily overestimated based on the qualitative analysis of the classified maps and validation statistics (error of commission 65{\%} as shown by the user's accuracy).However, on the other hand, the mapping of dead trees was possible with notably high overall accuracies (OAs) (84{\%}-96{\%}). These results could also be transferred to the second independent hyperspectral image, in which the separation between the healthy trees and the dead trees was possible with OAs of 94{\%}-97{\%}. Somewhat lower but still reasonable OAs (76{\%}-85{\%}) were found when all defined classes were considered. The main confusion occurred between dead trees and sparsely vegetated soil. GA analysis showed that bands that notably contributed to high classification accuracies were frequently located in the visual part of the spectrum, close to the green peak (560. nm), as well as around the chlorophyll absorption feature (680. nm) and the red edge rise (690. nm). In some of the tested cases, additional bands in the SWIR (1532. nm) and one in the NIR (1076. nm) were stably selected by the GA, which indicated the importance of these bands in the classification process. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The increasing commercial availability of hyperspectral image data promotes growing interests in the development of application-specific narrow-band spectral vegetation indices (SVIs). However, the selection of the optimum SVIs for a particular purpose is not straightforward, due to the wide choice of band combinations and transformations, combined with specific application purposes and conditions. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop an approach for formulating and assessing narrow-band vegetation indices, particularly those from EO-1 Hyperion imagery. The focus of SVI development was for discriminating sugarcane areas affected by ‘orange rust' ( Pucci nia ku eh nii) disease in Mackay, Queensland, Australia. After a series of pre-processing and post-atmospheric correction techniques, an empirical-statistical approach to SVI development was designed and implemented. This included the following components: a) selection of sample pixels of diseased and non- diseased areas, b) visual examination of spectral plots to identify bands of maximum spectral separability, c) generation of SVIs, d) use of ant functi on an alys is , and e) result interpretation and validation. From the forty existing and newly developed vegetation indices, the output discriminant function (i.e. a linear combination of three indices) attained a classification accuracy of 96.9{\%} for the hold-out sample pixels. The statistical analyses also produced a list of function coefficients and correlation rankings that indicate the multiple discrimin predictive potential of each SVI. The newly formulated ‘Disease-Water Stress Indices' ( highest correlations. The approach designed for this study provided a systematic framework in the formulation DSWI ) produced the and assessment of SVIs for sugarcane disease detection.},

The sensitivity of this index to flow path algorithm and grid size is examined for the case where the surface topography is a good indicator of local hydraulic gradients.

abstract = {Tree mortality caused by bark beetle infestation has significant effects on the ecology and value of both natural and commercial forests. Therefore, prediction of bark beetle infestations is critical in forest management. Existing predictive models, however, rarely consider the influence of long-term stressors on forest susceptibility to bark beetle infestation. In this study we introduce pre-disturbance spectral trajectories from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery as an indicator of long-term stress into models of bark beetle infestation together with commonly used environmental predictors. Observations for this study come from forests in the central part of the {\v{S}}umava Mountains, in the border region between the Czech Republic and Germany, Central Europe. The areas of bark beetle-infested forest were delineated from aerial photographs taken in 1991 and in every year from 1994 to 2000. The environmental predictors represent forest stand attributes (e.g., tree density and distance to the infested forest from previous year) and common abiotic factors, such as topography, climate, geology, and soil. Pre-disturbance spectral trajectories were defined by the linear regression slope of Tasseled Cap components (Wetness, Brightness and Greenness) calculated from a time series of 16 Landsat TM images across years from 1984 until one year before the bark beetle infestation. Using logistic regression and multimodel inference, we calculated predictive models separately for each single year from 1994 to 2000 to account for a possible shift in importance of individual predictors during disturbance. Inclusion of two pre-disturbance spectral trajectories (Wetness slope and Brightness slope) significantly improved predictive ability of bark beetle infestation models. Wetness slope had the greatest predictive power, even relative to environmental predictors, and was relatively stable in its power over the years. Brightness slope improved the model only in the middle of the disturbance period (1996). Importantly, these pre-disturbance predictors were not correlated with other predictors, and therefore bring additional explanatory power to the model. Generally, the predictive power of most fitted model decreases as time progresses and models describing the initial phase of bark beetle outbreaks appear more reliable for conducting near-future predictions. The pre-disturbance spectral trajectories are valuable not only for assessing the risk of bark beetle infestation, but also for detection of long-term gradual changes even in non-forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {Bark beetles cause significant tree mortality in coniferous forests across North America. Mapping beetle-caused tree mortality is therefore important for gauging impacts to forest ecosystems and assessing trends. Remote sensing offers the potential for accurate, repeatable estimates of tree mortality in outbreak areas. With the advancement of multi-temporal disturbance detection methods using Landsat data, the capability exists for improvement in mapping methods, yet more information is needed to determine the accuracy of these methods for mapping forest disturbances and to quantify differences between these methods and single-date image classification methods. We compared single-date (using maximum likelihood classification) to multi-date (using time series of spectral indices) classification methods of Landsat imagery and investigated how detection accuracy changed with varying levels of mortality severity. For each method, we evaluated several bands and/or spectral vegetation indices and identified the one that resulted in the highest accuracy. A fine-resolution classified aerial image within the Landsat scene was used as reference data for evaluation and comparison between methods. For the single-date image classification, we achieved a 91.0{\%} (kappa = 0.88) overall accuracy with 11.7{\%} omission and 2.3{\%} commission errors for the red stage (tree mortality) class using the tasseled cap transformation indices of brightness, greenness, and wetness. For the multi-date analysis, the Band5/Band4 anomaly produced the highest accuracy among spectral indices and resulted in a 89.6{\%} (kappa = 0.86) classification accuracy with 12.6{\%} omission and 7.1{\%} commission errors for the red stage class. We compared accuracies between the best single- and multi-date methods across a range of tree mortality within a pixel. The multi-date method was more accurate at intermediate levels of tree mortality, whereas the single-date method was more accurate at high mortality levels. Our results indicate that Landsat-based mapping of forest disturbances that use either single-date or multi-date methods can result in high classification accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

We suggest to group studies into three insect types: bark beetles, broadleaved defoliators, and coniferous defoliators. By so doing, we systematically compare the sensors and methods used for mapping insect disturbances within and across insect types. Results suggest that there are substantial differences between methods used for mapping bark beetles and defoliators, and between methods used for mapping broadleaved and coniferous defoliators. Following from this, we highlight approaches that are particularly suited for each insect type. Finally, we conclude by highlighting future research directions for remote sensing of insect disturbances. In particular, we suggest to: 1) Separate insect disturbances from other agents; 2) Extend the spatial and temporal domain of analysis; 3) Make use of dense time series; 4) Operationalize near-real time monitoring of insect disturbances; 5) Identify insect disturbances in the context of coupled human-natural systems; and 6) Improve reference data for assessing insect disturbances. Since the remote sensing of insect disturbances has gained much interest beyond the remote sensing community recently, the future developments identified here will help integrating remote sensing products into operational forest management. Furthermore, an improved spatiotemporal quantification of insect disturbances will support an inclusion of these processes into regional to global ecosystem models.},

abstract = {In this study, the early stage of European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus, L.) infestation (so-called green attack) is investigated using Landsat-8 optical and thermal data. We conducted an extensive field survey in June and the beginning of July 2016, to collect field data measurements from several infested and healthy trees in the Bavarian Forest National Park (BFNP), Germany. In total, 157 trees were selected, and leaf traits (i.e. stomatal conductance, chlorophyll fluorescence, and water content) were measured. Three Landsat-8 images from May, July, and August 2016 were studied, representing an early stage, advanced stage, and post-infestation, respectively. Spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) sensitive to the measured traits were calculated from the optical domain (VIS, NIR, and SWIR), and canopy surface temperature (CST) was calculated from the thermal infrared band using the mono-window algorithm. The leaf traits were used to examine the impact of bark beetle infestation on the infested trees and to explore the link between these traits and remote sensing data (CST and SVIs). The differences between healthy and infested samples regarding measured leaf traits were assessed using Student's t test. The relative importance of the CST and SVIs for estimating measured leaf traits was evaluated based on the variable importance in projection (VIP) obtained from the partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis. A temporal comparison was then made for SVIs with a VIP {\textgreater} 1, including CST, using statistical significance tests. The clustering method using a principal components analysis (PCA) was used to examine visually how well the two groups of sample plots (healthy and infested) are separated in 2-D space based on principal component scores. Finally, linear regression (LR) was used to generate the leaf traits maps using the SVI that have highest VIP score and then used to produce a stress map for the study area. The results revealed that all measured leaf traits were significantly different (p {\textless} 0.05) between healthy versus infested samples. Moreover, the study showed that CST was superior to the SVIs in detecting subtle canopy changes due to bark beetle infestation for the three months considered in this study. The results showed that CST is an essential variable for estimating measured leaf traits with VIP {\textgreater} 1, improving the results of clustering when used with other SVIs. Likewise, the stress map produced by CST and leaf traits well presented the infestation areas at the green attacked stage. The new insight offered by this study is that the stress induced by the early stage of bark beetle infestation is more pronounced by Landsat-8 thermal bands than the SVIs calculated from its optical bands. The potential of CST in detecting the green attack stage would have positive implications for forest practice.},

abstract = {Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) is economically the most important European tree species but is particularly prone to insect infestation calamities. Among the biotic risks threatening Norway spruce in Europe the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus (L.) is the most significant pest. On the basis of projected climate-change scenarios higher temperatures and longer growing seasons will probably lead to even more frequent and serious outbreaks of this pest as a result of more generations per year. At the same time periods of drought may become more frequent and be of longer duration resulting in a physiological weakening of Norway spruce. Hence, it is necessary to develop concepts that can be used in long term silvicultural planning to minimize the risk of bark beetle infestations until trees reach maturity. For an adaptation of forest management it is necessary to identify and quantify risks at the level of silvicultural planning units. Therefore, we developed, a mixed binary linear regression model, which describes the effects of different stand and site variables on the infestation risk that bark beetles exert on spruce stands in the Harz Mountains. The relevant data are based on a decade of detailed forest booking records carried out by the Lower Saxony State Forest in the western Harz Mountains and cover 12,085 individual registrations on 4352 stands. In the model, the stand parameters age and proportion of spruce, and site parameters available water capacity, thermal sum and the Topex-to-Distance Index have significant effects on the infestation risk. It is presumed that the impact of various but unknown silvicultural measures and pest control tactics in managed forests can be quantified by random effects on the forest sub-district level.When applying our model it is possible to assign expected risk levels to single spruce stands. Thereby, we can add a biotic risk component to site-oriented silviculture. Thus, a mapped ranking of spruce stands pertaining to bark beetle infestation risk can be provided. In addition, specific silvicultural management strategies such as shortening of rotation periods or an admixture of broadleaved tree species can be derived from the model's predictions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Performance of a random k-fold cross-validation (CV) was compared to three target-oriented strategies: Leave-Location-Out (LLO), Leave-Time-Out (LTO), and Leave-Location-and-Time-Out (LLTO) CV. Results indicate that considerable differences between random k-fold (R2 = 0.9 for Tair and 0.92 for VW) and target-oriented CV (LLO R2 = 0.24 for Tair and 0.49 for VW) exist, highlighting the need for target-oriented validation to avoid an overoptimistic view on models. Differences between random k-fold and target-oriented CV indicate spatial over-fitting caused by misleading variables. To decrease over-fitting, a forward feature selection in conjunction with target-oriented CV is proposed. It decreased over-fitting and simultaneously improved target-oriented performances (LLO CV R2 = 0.47 for Tair and 0.55 for VW).},

abstract = {Information about vegetation water content (VWC) has widespread utility in agriculture, forestry, and hydrology. It is also useful in retrieving soil moisture from microwave remote sensing observations. Providing a VWC estimate allows us to control a degree of freedom in the soil moisture retrieval process. However, these must be available in a timely fashion in order to be of value to routine applications, especially soil moisture retrieval. As part of the Soil Moisture Experiments 2002 (SMEX02), the potential of using satellite spectral reflectance measurements to map and monitor VWC for corn and soybean canopies was evaluated. Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus data and ground-based VWC measurements were used to establish relationships based on remotely sensed indices. The two indices studied were the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The NDVI saturated during the study period while the NDWI continued to reflect changes in VWC. NDWI was found to be superior based upon a quantitative analysis of bias and standard error. The method developed was used to map daily VWC for the watershed over the 1-month experiment period. It was also extended to a larger regional domain. In order to develop more robust and operational methods, we need to look at how we can utilize the MODIS instruments on the Terra and Aqua platforms, which can provide daily temporal coverage. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

There is a steep moisture gradient from about 160 per cent in the outer sapwood to about 30 per cent in the heart-wood. The moisture content in the centre is slightly higher than in the adjacent wood. In infested trees the sapwood moisture is greatly reduced within a year after the attack but moisture in the heartwood is not altered appreciably. Trees infested early in the season drop to a lower moisture content by fall than trees infested later in the season. In non-infested trees there is a diurnal and a seasonal moisture march; these do not occur in infested trees. The rapid moisture loss in the sapwood of infested trees is associated with blue-stain infection and successful establishment of bark-beetle broods},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of optical indices from hyperspectral remote sensing in the assessment of vegetation biophysical variables both in forestry and agriculture. Those indices are, however, the combined response to variations of several vegetation and environmental properties, such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content, canopy shadows, and background soil reflectance. Of particular significance to precision agriculture is chlorophyll content, an indicator of photosynthesis activity, which is related to the nitrogen concentration in green vegetation and serves as a measure of the crop response to nitrogen application. This paper presents a combined modeling and indices-based approach to predicting the crop chlorophyll content from remote sensing data while minimizing LAI (vegetation parameter) influence and underlying soil (background) effects. This combined method has been developed first using simulated data and followed by evaluation in terms of quantitative predictive capability using real hyperspectral airborne data. Simulations consisted of leaf and canopy reflectance modeling with PROSPECT and SAILH radiative transfer models. In this modeling study, we developed an index that integrates advantages of indices minimizing soil background effects and indices that are sensitive to chlorophyll concentration. Simulated data have shown that the proposed index Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index/Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) is both very sensitive to chlorophyll content variations and very resistant to the variations of LAI and solar zenith angle. It was therefore possible to generate a predictive equation to estimate leaf chlorophyll content from the combined optical index derived from above-canopy reflectance. This relationship was evaluated by application to hyperspectral CASI imagery collected over corn crops in three experimental farms from Ontario and Quebec, Canada. The results presented here are from the L'Acadie, Quebec, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada research site. Images of predicted leaf chlorophyll content were generated. Evaluation showed chlorophyll variability over crop plots with various levels of nitrogen, and revealed an excellent agreement with ground truth, with a correlation of r2=.81 between estimated and field measured chlorophyll content data. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Conventional methods of monitoring forest health such as aerial survey and ground assessments are labor intensive, time consuming, and subjective. Remote sensing provides a synoptic view of the canopy and can indicate areas affected by damaging agents such as pests and pathogens. Hyperspectral airborne remote sensing imagery (CASI-2) was acquired over pine stands in southern New South Wales, Australia which had been ground assessed and ranked on an individual tree basis, according to the extent of Dothistroma needle blight. A series of spectral indices were tested using two different approaches for extracting crown-scale reflectance measurements and relating these to ground-based estimates of severity. Dothistroma needle blight is most severe in the lower crown and statistically significant relationships were found between crown reflectance values and ground estimates using a 'halo' approach (which ignored each tree crown's brightest central pixels). Independent accuracy assessment of the method indicated that the technique could successfully detect three levels of Dothistroma needle blight infection with an accuracy of over 70{\%}.},

This project addresses the most efficient and reliable remote sensing strategies for identifying and mapping, in a practical and cost effective manner, early infestation stages (current attack) of MPB and subsequent advanced stages including detection and mapping of “red attack” and monitoring infestation spread across time. Digitally converted multispectral aerial photography was found to perform best for early detection of current attack and mapping and monitoring red attack. Results indicate that a spreading current attack can be reliably detected between mid May and early June at our sites. For mapping red attack a scale of 1:16000 is recommended at this time. For early detection experiments the 1:8000 imagery was superior but the 1:16000 imagery would be operationally effective. Aerial photography (multispectral and digitally converted) is clearly the remote sensing imaging system that can most accurately and cost effectively addresses this critical MPB problem. Of equal importance is the capability of aerial photography being implemented in a timely fashion by both government and the private sector in a business environment using competitive tendering.},

abstract = {The European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus, L. (hereafter bark beetle), causes major economic loss to the forest industry in Europe, especially in Norway Spruce (Picea abies). To minimise economic loss and preclude a mass outbreak, early detection of bark beetle infestation (so-called “green attack” stage – a period at which trees are yet to show visual signs of infestation stress) is, therefore, a crucial step in the management of Norway spruce stands. It is expected that a bark beetle infestation at the green attack stage affects a tree's physiological and chemical status. However, the concurrent effect on key foliar biochemical such as foliar nitrogen and chlorophyll as well as spectral responses are not well documented in the literature. Therefore, in this study, the early detection of bark beetle green attacks is investigated by examining foliar biochemical and spectral properties (400–2000 nm). We also assessed whether bark beetle infestation affects the estimation accuracy of foliar biochemicals. An extensive field survey was conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park (BFNP), Germany, in the early summer of 2015 to collect leaf samples from 120 healthy and green attacked trees. The spectra of the leaf samples were measured using an ASD FieldSpec3 equipped with an integrating sphere. Significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) between healthy and infested needle samples were found in the mean reflectance spectra, with the most pronounced differences being observed in the NIR and SWIR regions between 730 and 1370 nm. Furthermore, significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) were found in the biochemical compositions (chlorophyll and nitrogen concentration) of healthy versus green attacked samples. Our results further demonstrate that the estimation accuracy of foliar chlorophyll and nitrogen concentrations, utilising partial least square regression model, was lower for the infested compared to the healthy trees. We show that early stage of infestation reduces not only foliar biochemical content but also their retrieval accuracy. Our results further indicate that remote sensing measurements can be successfully used for the early detection of the bark beetle infestation. We demonstrated that bark beetle infestation at the green attack stage effects leaf spectral response as well as leaf biochemical properties and their retrievals from hyperspectral measurements.},

abstract = {In Central Europe and North America, bark beetle infestations cause considerable economic losses. If infested trees are not rapidly removed, large areas can be damaged. Removal of infested trees has to be done during the so-called "green-attack" stage, which is before the bark beetles move to other trees. Field surveys even if they are feasible are cost intensive and impractical if large areas have to be monitored. The aim of the study was to analyse the suitability of 8-band WorldView-2 satellite imagery for detecting bark beetle infestations of two intensity stages (e.g. "dead" and "green-attack") against "healthy" (nonattacked) trees. For classifying individual trees two classifiers, random forest and logistic regression, were evaluated. Despite the relative large class overlap in the spectral signatures, the sample trees (n = 600) could be assigned to the classes "dead", "green-attack", and "healthy" with an overall accuracy of about 75{\%}. Producer's and user's accuracies of all classes were around 70{\%}. The best result was obtained with random forests using the eight spectral bands of a WorldView-2 image acquired in July. With this dataset, an overall accuracy of 76{\%} and a kappa coefficient of 0.61 were achieved. For the separation of the classes "healthy" and "greenattack", vegetation indices based on 2-band normalized differences as well as ratios yielded nearly as good results as the classification with all eight spectral bands. The best results were obtained by combining either the Green or Yellow band with the Near Infrared 1. With regard to individual bands, the Yellow and the Red band are defined as most important ones. We can conclude that 8-band WorldView-2 imagery has the potential for creating hotspot maps of infested trees or of trees with an increased risk of infestation. This could have positive implications for the forest practice.},

abstract = {Examination of the physical background underlying the ERS response of forest and analysis of time series of ERS data indicates that the greater temporal stability of forest compared with many other types of land cover presents a means of mapping forest area. The processing chain necessary to make such area estimations involves reconstruction of an optimal estimate of the backscattering coefficient at each pixel using temporal and spatial filtering so that classification rules derived from large scale averaging are applicable. The rationale behind the filtering strategy and the level of averaging needed is explained in terms of the observed multitemporal behavior of forest and nonforest areas. Much of this analysis is generic and applicable to a wide range of situation in which significant information is carried by multitemporal features of the data. The choice of decision rules is based on the forest observations, with the added requirement for robustness. The performance of a classifier based only on change is assessed on a range of test sites in the U.K., Finland, and Poland. Error sources in this classifier are identified, and the possibility of improving performance by including radiometric information in the mapping strategy is discussed. Brief discussions of how the classification is affected by the addition of coherence and how the processing chain would need to be modified for other forms of satellite data are included.},

abstract = {Efficient methods to monitor forested areas help us to better understand their processes. To date, only a few studies have assessed the usability of multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets in this context. Here we present an analysis of an unprecedented set of C-band observations of mixed temperate forests. We demonstrate the potential of using multitemporal C-band VV and VH polarisation data for monitoring phenology and classifying forests in northern Switzerland. Each SAR acquisition was first radiometrically terrain corrected using digital elevation model-based image simulations of the local illuminated area. The flattened backscatter values and the local area values were input to a temporal compositing process integrating backscatter values from ascending and descending tracks. The process used local resolution weighting of each input, producing composite backscatter values that strongly mitigated terrain-induced distortions. Several descriptors were calculated to show the seasonal variation of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), oak (Quercus robur, Quercus petraea) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) in C-band data. Using their distinct seasonal signatures, the timing of leaf emergence and leaf fall of the deciduous species were estimated and compared to available ground observations. Furthermore, classifications for the forest types 'deciduous' and 'coniferous' and the investigated species were implemented using random forest classifiers. The deciduous species backscatter was about 1 dB higher than spruce throughout the year in both polarisations. The forest types showed opposing seasonal backscatter behaviours. At VH, deciduous species showed higher backscatter in winter than in summer, whereas spruce showed higher backscatter in summer than in winter. In VV, this pattern was similar for spruce, while no distinct seasonal behaviour was apparent for the deciduous species. The time differences between the estimations and the ground observations of the phenological events were approximately within the error margin (±12 days) of the temporal resolution. The classification performances were promising, with higher accuracies achieved for the forest types (OA of 86{\%} and k = 0.73) than for individual species (OA of 72{\%} and k = 0.58). These results show that multitemporal C-band backscatter data have significant potential to supplement optical remote sensing data for ecological studies and mapping of mixed temperate forests.},

For seven test sites from various ecoregions in North and South America, ERS-l/JERS-1 composites were generated using high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data for terrain correction of geometric and radiometric distortions. An edge-preserving speckle reduction process was applied to reduce the fading variance and prepare the data for an unsupervised clustering of the two-dimensional (2-D) SAR feature space. Signature-based classification of the clusters was performed for all test sites with the same set of radar backscatter signatures, which were measured from well-defined polygons throughout all test sites. While trained on one-half of the polygons, the classification result was tested against the other half of the total sample population. The multisite study was followed by a multitemporal study in one test site, clearly showing the necessity of including multitemporal data beyond a level 1 (woody, herbaceous, mixed) vegetation characterization. Finally, classifications with simulation of backscatter variations shows the dependence of the classification results on calibration accuracy and on naturally occurring backscatter changes of natural surfaces. Overall, it is demonstrated that the combination of existing orbital L- and C-band SAR data is quite powerful for structural vegetation characterization. {\textcopyright} 1998 IEEE.},

abstract = {Insect defoliation is a major disturbance force in forested ecosystems. Monitoring outbreaks, and estimating the areas affected, is therefore important for both forest managers and forest ecologists. The objective of our study was to classify jack pine budworm defoliation levels in Landsat TM imagery recorded previous to and during the 1990–1995 outbreak in our 450,000 ha study area in northwestern Wisconsin (USA). Many previous studies correlated insect defoliation and remotely sensed imagery with moderate to good success, but it often remained unclear if actual defoliation effects or other forest attributes correlated with defoliation were detected. For example, a larger deciduous component in mixed jack pine stands will limit budworm populations and thereby defoliation. The deciduous component in stands is a determining factor for insect defoliation, whereas needle discoloration and tree mortality are their effect. We used pre-outbreak Landsat TM data (1987) to identify determining factors for jack pine budworm population levels and peak-outbreak imagery (1993) for detecting actual defoliation. Our satellite data were atmospherically corrected using a radiative transfer model (5S). Spectral mixture analysis was performed using spectrometer measurements of jack pine needles and bark as representations of surface materials (“endmembers”). The explanatory power of the resulting fraction images was evaluated using jack pine budworm population data collected at 33 sampling points. Near-infrared reflectance (NIR) increased in defoliated stands between 1987 and 1993, but single date NIR in each year was negatively correlated with budworm levels in 1993 (r=−0.69 and −0.47). This was because hardwood trees within jack pine stands caused higher NIR reflectance but limited jack pine budworm populations. The 10{\%} NIR difference between pure and mixed jack pine stands outweighed the 3–5{\%} increase in NIR due to defoliation and necessitated stratification of the satellite data by tree species. Spectral mixture analysis performed on pure jack pine stands resulted in a strong negative correlation between the 1993 green needle fraction and the 1993 budworm population data (r=−0.94). This study was, to our knowledge, the first that applied spectral mixture analysis for forest damage detection, and also the first to use insect population measurements as independent field data. These methods, and the separation of determinants and effects of jack pine budworm defoliation, enabled us to detect actual defoliation with high accuracy.},

abstract = {This study compiles and summarizes the existing knowledge about observed and projected impacts of climate change on forests in Europe. Forests will have to adapt not only to changes in mean climate variables but also to increased variability with greater risk of extreme weather events, such as prolonged drought, storms and floods. Sensitivity, potential impacts, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability to climate change are reviewed for European forests. The most important potential impacts of climate change on forest goods and services are summarized for the Boreal, Temperate Oceanic, Temperate Continental, Mediterranean, and mountainous regions. Especially in northern and western Europe the increasing atmospheric CO2 content and warmer temperatures are expected to result in positive effects on forest growth and wood production, at least in the short-medium term. On the other hand, increasing drought and disturbance risks will cause adverse effects. These negative impacts are very likely to outweigh positive trends in southern and eastern Europe. From west to east, the drought risk increases. In the Mediterranean regions productivity is expected to decline due to strongly increased droughts and fire risks. Adaptive capacity consists of the inherent adaptive capacity of trees and forest ecosystems and of socio-economic factors determining the capability to implement planned adaptation. The adaptive capacity in the forest sector is relatively large in the Boreal and the Temperate Oceanic regions, more constrained by socio-economic factors in the Temperate Continental, and most limited in the Mediterranean region where large forest areas are only extensively managed or unmanaged. Potential impacts and risks are best studied and understood with respect to wood production. It is clear that all other goods and services provided by European forests will also be impacted by climate change, but much less knowledge is available to quantify these impacts. Understanding of adaptive capacity and regional vulnerability to climate change in European forests is not well developed and requires more focussed research efforts. An interdisciplinary research agenda integrated with monitoring networks and projection models is needed to provide information at all levels of decision making, from policy development to the management unit. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An accurate vegetation index is required to identify plant biomass versus soil and residue backgrounds for automated remote sensing and machine vision applications, plant ecological assessments, precision crop management, and weed control. An improved vegetation index, Excess Green minus Excess Red (ExG - ExR) was compared to the commonly used Excess Green (ExG), and the normalized difference (NDI) indices. The latter two indices used an Otsu threshold value to convert the index near-binary to a full-binary image. The indices were tested with digital color image sets of single plants grown and taken in a greenhouse and field images of young soybean plants. Vegetative index accuracies using a separation quality factor algorithm were compared to hand-extracted plant regions of interest. A quality factor of one represented a near perfect binary match of the computer extracted plant target compared to the hand-extracted plant region. The ExG - ExR index had the highest quality factor of 0.88 ± 0.12 for all three weeks and soil-residue backgrounds for the greenhouse set. The ExG + Otsu and NDI - Otsu indices had similar but lower quality factors of 0.53 ± 0.39 and 0.54 ± 0.33 for the same sets, respectively. Field images of young soybeans against bare soil gave quality factors for both ExG - ExR and ExG + Otsu around 0.88 ± 0.07. The quality factor of NDI + Otsu using the same field images was 0.25 ± 0.08. The ExG - ExR index has a fixed, built-in zero threshold, so it does not need Otsu or any user selected threshold value. The ExG - ExR index worked especially well for fresh wheat straw backgrounds, where it was generally 55{\%} more accurate than the ExG + Otsu and NDI + Otsu indices. Once a binary plant region of interest is identified with a vegetation index, other advanced image processing operations may be applied, such as identification of plant species for strategic weed control. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {High spatial resolution remotely sensed data has the potential to complement existing forest health programs for both strategic planning over large areas, as well as for detailed and precise identification of tree crowns subject to stress and infestation. The area impacted by the current mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, has increased 40-fold over the previous 5 years, with approximately 8.5 million ha of forest infested in 2005. As a result of the spatial extent and intensity of the outbreak, new technologies are being assessed to help detect, map, and monitor the damage caused by the beetle, and to inform mitigation of future beetle outbreaks. In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of high spatial resolution QuickBird multi-spectral imagery to detect mountain pine beetle red attack damage. ANOVA testing of individual spectral bands, as well as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a ratio of red to green reflectance (Red-Green Index or RGI), indicated that the RGI was the most successful (p {\textless} 0.001) at separating non-attack crowns from red attack crowns. Based on this result, the RGI was subsequently used to develop a binary classification of red attack and non-attack pixels. The total number of QuickBird pixels classified as having red attack damage within a 50 m buffer of a known forest health survey point were compared to the number of red attack trees recorded at the time of the forest health survey. The relationship between the number of red attack pixels and observed red attack crowns was assessed using independent validation data and was found to be significant (r2 = 0.48, p {\textless} 0.001, standard error = 2.8 crowns). A comparison of the number of QuickBird pixels classified as red attack, and a broader scale index of mountain pine beetle red attack damage (Enhanced Wetness Difference Index, calculated from a time series of Landsat imagery), was significant (r2 = 0.61, p {\textless} 0.001, standard error = 1.3 crowns). These results suggest that high spatial resolution imagery, in particular QuickBird satellite imagery, has a valuable role to play in identifying tree crowns with red attack damage. This information could subsequently be used to augment existing detailed forest health surveys, calibrate synoptic estimates of red attack damage generated from overview surveys and/or coarse scale remotely sensed data, and facilitate the generation of value-added information products, such as estimates of timber volume impacts at the forest stand level. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background: Qualitative research makes an important contribution to our understanding of health and healthcare. However, qualitative evidence can be difficult to search for and identify, and the effectiveness of different types of search strategies is unknown. Methods: Three search strategies for qualitative research in the example area of support for breast-feeding were evaluated using six electronic bibliographic databases. The strategies were based on using thesaurus terms, free-text terms and broad-based terms. These strategies were combined with recognised search terms for support for breast-feeding previously used in a Cochrane review. For each strategy, we evaluated the recall (potentially relevant records found) and precision (actually relevant records found). Results: A total yield of 7420 potentially relevant records was retrieved by the three strategies combined. Of these, 262 were judged relevant. Using one strategy alone would miss relevant records. The broad-based strategy had the highest recall and the thesaurus strategy the highest precision. Precision was generally poor: 96{\%} of records initially identified as potentially relevant were deemed irrelevant. Searching for qualitative research involves trade-offs between recall and precision. Conclusions: These findings confirm that strategies that attempt to maximise the number of potentially relevant records found are likely to result in a large number of false positives. The findings also suggest that a range of search terms is required to optimise searching for qualitative evidence. This underlines the problems of current methods for indexing qualitative research in bibliographic databases and indicates where improvements need to be made.},

Some areas were left without human intervention and, consequently, the trees around these areas were removed to stop further bark beetle outbreak. The objective of our study was the assessment of surface temperature (ST) change in spruce forest decayed under bark beetle and following clear-cutting. The change detection of ST is based on the comparison of modelled values and thermal satellite data. For this purpose, Landsat scenes from July 11th, 1987 and July 28th, 2002 were used. The models describe the dependence of ST of living spruce forest on topography. The topography effect is based on the Altitude and Hillshade index, which expresses the influence of Aspect and Slope on the relief illumination. Then the modelled ST values were extrapolated for decayed spruce forest and clear-cut areas. In order to increase model accuracy, the forest edge zones (90 m wide) were removed because of their different energy balance; then explained variability value (R2) increased from 0.37 to 0.55. The results of comparing modelled values with satellite ST in the decayed spruce forest and clear-cut areas show an average increase of ST by 5.2 and 3.5°C, respectively. The thermal satellite data from 1987 were used for model validation. This showed that the accuracy of ST modelling using topography was sufficient, because the difference between the modelled ST with and without decayed spruce forest and clear-cut areas was at most only 0.4°C. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2008.},

abstract = {Tree-killing bark beetle species such as Ips sp. and Dendroctonus sp. are considered one of the most severe biotic hazards affecting forests at the global scale. Although spatio-temporal patterns of dispersal and infestations have been widely observed and statistically analyzed profound knowledge about the host-bark beetle interactions that evoke these patterns is scarce. We developed an individual-based and spatially explicit model - the Infestation Pattern Simulation (IPS) model - to elucidate how individual traits affect system-level dispersal and infestation patterns. IPS simulates processes including dispersal, host selection, aggregation, and finally colonization, or rejection by host defence on a local scale. Host-bark beetle interactions are implemented highly dynamically, i.e. individual adaptive behavior takes into account space- and time-dependent variations in traits. Simulations consider one dispersal wave starting from a single source located in a virtual stand. Finally, the effects of both bark beetle- and host tree-specific parameters on emerging system patterns were quantified using a one-factor-at-a-time sensitivity analysis approach. As system-level response variables we used (i) percentage of successful beetles, (ii) number of infestations, and (iii) maximum infestation distance to source. Among bark beetle-specific parameters those affecting host recognition (e.g. perceptual range, energetic level) and attack synchrony (e.g. source size, time lag between flight cohorts) were revealed to be highly sensitive with regard to all three response variables. In addition, the host tree's resistance and spatial distribution is also shown to be decisive for infestation occurrence. The model provides a conceptual framework linking individual behavior to system-level patterns. Thus it represents a powerful tool - complementing lab- and field-based approaches - which may contribute to our understanding of the complex spatio-temporal processes that govern host-bark beetle dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Natural disturbances significantly influence forest ecosystem services and biodiversity. Accurate delineation and early detection of areas affected by wind and insect outbreaks are crucial for guiding management decisions. To this end, past studies relied mostly on passive sensors (e.g., optical), and active sensors (i.e., radar) were rarely used. This study used L-band space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) within a change-detection framework to delineate forested areas affected by wind and insect disturbances. The results showed that changes in backscatter relate to damage caused by wind and insect outbreaks. Overall accuracies of 69–84{\%} and 65–88{\%} were obtained for delineation of areas affected by wind damage and insect outbreaks, respectively, depending on the acquisition date and environmental conditions. Areas susceptible to insect outbreaks or experiencing the initial outbreak phase (green) were detected with lower accuracies (64–74{\%}). It is expected that L-band space-borne SAR data can be applied over larger areas and ecosystem types in the temperate and boreal regions to delineate and detect damaged areas.},

A set of narrow-band and broad-band Vegetation Indices (VIs) have been developed to assess the changes in the vegetation reflectance. The main objective of the study is to assess the damages caused by European Spruce Bark Beetle (Ips typographus L.) infestation in 'Bistrishko Branishte' UNESCO Man And Biosphere (MAB) reserve using WorldView-2 satellite data. The analysis was performed on Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest using the VIs indicative for forest stress: NDVI, SR, EVI, ARVI, CRI, CSc, and ARI. By applying density slice on the VIs, the main regions for stressed vegetation have been delineated. The CSc has been found to perform better in detecting the pattern of stressed spruce trees compared to ARI. The area affected by Ips typographus was determined by CSc index to 5.97{\%} (0.373 km 2) of the study area.},

abstract = {Red-attack damage caused by mountain pine beetle (Dentroctonus ponderosa Hopkins) infestation in stands of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) in the Prince George Forest Region of British Columbia was examined using multitemporal Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery acquired in 1999, 2000, and 2001. The image data were geometrically and atmospherically corrected, and processed using the Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) to obtain wetness indices. The final steps included pixel subtraction, enhancement, and thresholding of the wetness index differences. The resulting enhanced wetness difference index (EWDI) was used to interpret spectral patterns in stands with confirmed (through aerial survey) red-attack damage in 2001, and these EWDI patterns were compared to the patterns of reflectance in normal-colour composites. We stratified the aerial survey dataset into two levels and used the EWDI to discriminate classes of 10-29 red-attack trees and 30-50 red-attack trees, and a sample of healthy forest collected from inventory data. Classification accuracy of red-attack damage based on the EWDI ranged from 67{\%} to 78{\%} correct. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Purpose of Review: The overall objective of this paper is to review the state of knowledge on the application of radar data for detecting bark beetle attacks in forests. Due to the increased availability of high spatial and temporal resolution radar data (e.g. Sentinel-1 (S1)), the question is how this time series data can support operational forest management with respect to forest insect damage prevention. Furthermore, available radar systems will be listed and their potential for detecting bark beetle attacks will be discussed. To increase the understanding of the potential of radar time series for detecting bark beetle outbreaks, a theoretical background about the interaction of the radar signals with the forest canopy is given. Finally, gaps in the available knowledge are identified and future research questions are formulated which could advance our understanding of using radar data for detecting forest bark beetle attacks. Recent Findings: Few studies already demonstrate the high potential of S1 time series data for forest disturbance mapping in general. It was demonstrated that multi-temporal S1 data provide an excellent data source of describing the phenological characteristics of forests, which provide the basic knowledge for detecting bark beetle induced forest damages. It has been found that the optimal time for data acquisition is April to June for the pre-event and August to October for the post-event acquisitions. Summary: For detecting bark beetle induced forest damages, the literature review shows that mono-temporal radar data are of limited use, that shorter wavelength (e.g. C-band; X-band) have a higher potential than longer wavelength such as L-band and that the current S1 time series data have a high potential for operational applications.},

abstract = {Pathogen and pest outbreaks are recognized as key processes in the dynamics of Western forest ecosystems, yet the spatial patterns of stress and mortality are often complex and difficult to describe in an explicit spatial context, especially when considering the concurrent effects of multiple agents. Blister rust, a fungal pathogen, and mountain pine beetle, an insect pest, are two dominant sources of stress and mortality to high-altitude whitebark pine within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). In whitebark pine populations infested with blister rust or mountain pine beetle, the shift from green to red needles at the outer-most branches is an early sign of stress and infestation. In this analysis, we investigated a method that combines field surveys with a remote sensing classification and spatial analysis to differentiate the effects of these two agents of stress and mortality within whitebark pine. Hyperspectral remotely sensed images from the airborne HyMap sensor were classified to determine the locations of stress and mortality in whitebark pine crowns through sub-pixel mixture-tuned matched-filter analysis in three areas of the GYE in September 2000 and July 2006. Differences in the spatial pattern of blister rust and mountain pine beetle infestation allowed us to separate areas dominated by mountain pine beetle versus blister rust by examining changes in the spatial scale of significant stress and mortality clusters computed by the Ripley's K algorithm. At two field sites the distance between clusters of whitebark pine stress and mortality decreased from 2000 to 2006, indicating domination by the patchy spatial pattern of blister rust infestation. At another site, the distance between significant stress and mortality clusters increased from 2000 to 2006, indicating that the contiguous pattern of mountain pine beetle infestation was the primary source of disturbance. Analysis of these spatial stress and mortality patterns derived from remote sensing yields insight to the relative importance of blister rust and mountain pine beetle dynamics in the landscape. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Serious damage to Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) in Central and Western Europe together with increasing preference for forests with natural species composition emphasise the necessity to convert Norway spruce plantations on unsuitable sites and outside of its natural distribution. Site related priority assessment of Norway spruce replacement by Fagus sylvatica L., Quercus robur L., Acer pseudoplatanus L. and Fraxinus excelsior L., respectively, was calculated using a geographical information system for a management unit of 1248 ha in Upper Austria. Three matrix overlays combining soil depth with soil skeleton and vegetation type with gleyification resulted in different risk categories for Norway spruce. Further matrix overlay with Norway spruce stocking indicated sites with high conversion priority. Suitability indices of broadleaf species were evaluated using indexing overlay, allowing to weight map attributes of seven site parameters. This calculation was done separately for each species studied. Combination of these suitability indices with the conversion priority of Norway spruce led to site-related introduction priorities. The largest areas ware found for Q. robur, followed by F. sylvatica. The higher suitability of Q. robur compared to F. sylvatica was explained by its superior adaptation to the acidic, shallow and partially gleyic soils in the area. The introduction of F. excelsior was generally not found advisable. The advantage of this method over the use of classic site classification was seen in the direct implementation of current stand characteristics into the decision rules.},

abstract = {Assessments of ecosystem functioning rely heavily on quantification of vegetation properties. The search is on for methods that produce reliable and accurate baseline information on plant functional traits. In this study, the inversion of the PROSPECT radiative transfer model was used to estimate two functional leaf traits: leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA). Inversion of PROSPECT usually aims at quantifying its direct input parameters. This is the first time the technique has been used to indirectly model LDMC and SLA. Biophysical parameters of 137 leaf samples were measured in July 2013 in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. Spectra of the leaf samples were measured using an ASD FieldSpec3 equipped with an integrating sphere. PROSPECT was inverted using a look-up table (LUT) approach. The LUTs were generated with and without using prior information. The effect of incorporating prior information on the retrieval accuracy was studied before and after stratifying the samples into broadleaf and conifer categories. The estimated values were evaluated using R2 and normalized root mean square error (nRMSE). Among the retrieved variables the lowest nRMSE (0.0899) was observed for LDMC. For both traits higher R2 values (0.83 for LDMC and 0.89 for SLA) were discovered in the pooled samples. The use of prior information improved accuracy of the retrieved traits. The strong correlation between the estimated traits and the NIR/SWIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum suggests that these leaf traits could be assessed at canopy level by using remotely sensed data.},

abstract = {The nature of "climate change" will differ with geographical regions and its final impact on ecosystems vary with the extent of temperature increase, changes in irradiance and levels of UVB, amount and patterns of precipitation and humidity, and alterations in the incidence and nature of abiotic disturbances. Despite many uncertainties, there is consensus in the fact that global warming already has and will have impact on the temporal and spatial dynamics of insect herbivores. Ectothermic organisms are affected by the changes in environmental conditions directly in dispersal, reproduction, development and mortality, and indirectly through altered plant nutritional quality, resistance and via community interactions. Ambiguous consequences are to be expected depending on the individual host plant and herbivore species, probably involving altered incidence and intensity of pest outbreaks and changes in distributional ranges. Regions that represent northern or upper limits of occurrence, such as the Alps or the boreal zone, are likely to be affected most by an increase in stability and population density of certain pest species, such as defoliating insects or bark beetles. At the same time, temperature increase and drought will render areas of distribution in southern and continental parts of Europe less suitable for heat susceptible species, which will probably not only result in northwards shifts, but range contractions. The review is based on chapters of the "Study on impacts of climate change on European forests and options for adaptation" led by the European Forest Institute (Efi) and on results of the EU project "PROMOTH - Global change and pine processionary moth: a new challenge for integrated pest management". Thaumetopoea pityocampa serves as illustrative example for insect herbivores whose latitudinal and altitudinal distribution is mainly controlled by temperature and already modified by global warming. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The incidence of natural disturbance in forests is increasing globally as a consequence of global warming. The concomitant large-scale transformation of landscapes can have profound social impacts and trigger political conflict that hampers resource management. This paper explores the link between landscape transformations and political conflict using the example of the bark beetle epidemic in Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. For a significant part of the local population, the bark beetle represented a threat to their homeland and the post-disturbance landscape of dead wood reflected the dominance of outside interests in land management. This resentment sparked the formation of a local political movement, which was successful in pressing for changes in the current land management policy that were based on the ideal of a green forest landscape that needed to be protected by human intervention. An alternative interpretation of the post-disturbance landscape, however, welcomed it as a step towards authentic wilderness and opposed interventions to control the bark beetle. These contrasting understandings of the post-disturbance landscape underpin the protracted political conflict over the appropriate management of natural disturbance that has been smouldering for more than 20 years. The article concludes that it is vital to understand the cultural meaning of landscapes before adopting a disturbance management policy in order to avoid paralysing political conflict and social unrest. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) have been shown to be useful for an indirect detection of plant diseases. However, these indices have not been evaluated to detect or to differentiate between plant diseases on crop plants. The aim of this study was to develop specific spectral disease indices (SDIs) for the detection of diseases in crops. Sugar beet plants and the three leaf diseases Cercospora leaf spot, sugar beet rust and powdery mildew were used as model system. Hyperspectral signatures of healthy and diseased sugar beet leaves were assessed with a non-imaging spectroradiometer at different developing stages and disease severities of pathogens. Significant and most relevant wavelengths and two band normalized differences from 450 to 950. nm, describing the impact of a disease on sugar beet leaves were extracted from the data-set using the RELIEF-F algorithm. To develop hyperspectral indices for the detection of sugar beet diseases the best weighted combination of a single wavelength and a normalized wavelength difference was exhaustively searched testing all possible combinations. The optimized disease indices were tested for their ability to detect and to classify healthy and diseased sugar beet leaves. With a high accuracy and sensitivity healthy sugar beet leaves and leaves, infected with Cercospora leaf spot, sugar beet rust and powdery mildew were classified (balanced classification accuracy: 89{\%}, 92{\%}, 87{\%}, 85{\%}, respectively). Spectral disease indices were also successfully applied on hyperspectral imaging data and on non-imaging data from a sugar beet field. Specific disease indices will improve disease detection, identification and monitoring in precision agriculture applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Machine learning algorithms find frequent application in spatial prediction of biotic and abiotic environmental variables. However, the characteristics of spatial data, especially spatial autocorrelation, are widely ignored. We hypothesize that this is problematic and results in models that can reproduce training data but are unable to make spatial predictions beyond the locations of the training samples. We assume that not only spatial validation strategies but also spatial variable selection is essential for reliable spatial predictions. We introduce two case studies that use remote sensing to predict land cover and the leaf area index for the “Marburg Open Forest”, an open research and education site of Marburg University, Germany. We use the machine learning algorithm Random Forests to train models using non-spatial and spatial cross-validation strategies to understand how spatial variable selection affects the predictions. Our findings confirm that spatial cross-validation is essential in preventing overoptimistic model performance. We further show that highly autocorrelated predictors (such as geolocation variables, e.g. latitude, longitude) can lead to considerable overfitting and result in models that can reproduce the training data but fail in making spatial predictions. The problem becomes apparent in the visual assessment of the spatial predictions that show clear artefacts that can be traced back to a misinterpretation of the spatially autocorrelated predictors by the algorithm. Spatial variable selection could automatically detect and remove such variables that lead to overfitting, resulting in reliable spatial prediction patterns and improved statistical spatial model performance. We conclude that in addition to spatial validation, a spatial variable selection must be considered in spatial prediction models of ecological data to produce reliable results.},

abstract = {Nonindigenous species have caused significant impacts to North American forests despite past and present international phytosanitary efforts. Though broadly acknowledged, the risks of pest invasions are difficult to quantify as they involve interactions between many factors that operate across a range of spatial and temporal scales: the transmission of invading organisms via various pathways, their spread and establishment in new environments. Our study presents a stochastic simulation approach to quantify these risks and associated uncertainties through time in a unified fashion. We outline this approach with an example of a forest pest recently detected in North America, Sirex noctilio Fabricius. We simulate new potential entries of S. noctilio as a stochastic process, based on recent volumes of marine shipments of commodities from countries where S. noctilio is established, as well as the broad dynamics of foreign marine imports. The results are then linked with a spatial model that simulates the spread of S. noctilio within the geographical distribution of its hosts (pines) while incorporating existing knowledge about its behavior in North American landscapes. Through replications, this approach yields a spatial representation of S. noctilio risks and uncertainties in a single integrated product. The approach should also be appealing to decisionmakers, since it accounts for projected flows of commodities that may serve as conduits for pest entry. Our 30-year forecasts indicate high establishment probability in Ontario, Quebec, and the northeastern United States, but further southward expansion of S. noctilio is uncertain, ultimately depending on the impact of recent international treatment standards for wood packing materials. {\textcopyright} 2009 society for Risk Analysis.},

abstract = {The calculation of slope (downhill gradient) for a point in a digital elevation model (DEM) is a common procedure in the hydrological, environmental and remote sensing sciences. The most commonly used slope calculation algorithms employed on DEM topography data make use of a three-by-three search window or kernel centered on the grid point (grid cell) in question in order to calculate the slope at that point. A comparison of eight such slope calculation algorithms has been carried out using an artificial DEM, consisting of a smooth synthetic test surface with various amounts of added Gaussian noise. Morrison's Surface III, a trigonometrically defined surface, was used as the synthetic test surface. Residual slope grids were calculated by subtracting the slope grids produced by the algorithms on test from true/reference slope grids derived by analytic partial differentiation of the synthetic surface. The resulting residual slope grids were used to calculate root-mean-square (RMS) residual error estimates that were used to rank the slope algorithms from 'best' (lowest value of RMS residual error) to 'worst' (largest value of RMS residual error). Fleming and Hoffer's method gave the 'best' results for slope estimation when values of added Gaussian noise were very small compared to the mean smooth elevation difference (MSED) measured within three-by-three elevation point windows on the synthetic surface. Horn's method (used in ArcInfo GRID) performed better than Fleming and Hoffer's as a slope estimator when the noise amplitude was very much larger than the MSED. For the large noise amplitude situation the 'best' overall performing method was that of Sharpnack and Akin. The popular Maximum Downward Gradient Method (MDG) performed poorly coming close to last in the rankings, for both situations, as did the Simple Method. A nonogram was produced in terms of standard deviation of the Gaussian noise and MSED values that gave the locus of the trade-off point between Fleming and Hoffer's and Horn's methods.},

abstract = {Temperature is probably the most important driver of insect response to climate change and has many implications at both individual and population levels. The present study explored how elevation, as a proxy for temperature, affects the abundance and diversity of bark and wood-boring beetles associated with Norway spruce (Picea abies) along its southern range. We selected three elevational gradients (approximately 900-1500m) in spruce stands in the south-eastern Alps, each consisting of four locations. From April to September 2011, four traps of different types were installed at each location: three baited with generic lures ($\alpha$-pinene and ethanol) and one baited with a pheromone specific for Ips typographus. In addition, three fresh spruce logs were exposed on the same locations. Species richness did not vary significantly with elevation, whereas the abundance of most individual species did. Generally, aggressive species responded positively to higher temperature, whereas most non-aggressive species responded negatively. In a warming scenario, it is likely that spruce forests will face increasing damage from aggressive species. This will threaten the growth and survival of Norway spruce at low elevation, especially at southern latitudes. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Royal Entomological Society.},

abstract = {Natural disturbances play a key role in ecosystem dynamics and are important factors for sustainable forest ecosystem management. Quantitative models are frequently employed to tackle the complexities associated with disturbance processes. Here we review the wide variety of approaches to modelling natural disturbances in forest ecosystems, addressing the full spectrum of disturbance modelling from single events to integrated disturbance regimes. We applied a general, process-based framework founded in disturbance ecology to analyze modelling approaches for drought, wind, forest fires, insect pests and ungulate browsing. Modelling approaches were reviewed by disturbance agent and mechanism, and a set of general disturbance modelling concepts was deduced. We found that although the number of disturbance modelling approaches emerging over the last 15 years has increased strongly, statistical concepts for descriptive modelling are still largely prevalent over mechanistic concepts for explanatory and predictive applications. Yet, considering the increasing importance of disturbances for forest dynamics and ecosystem stewardship under anthropogenic climate change, the latter concepts are crucial tool for understanding and coping with change in forest ecosystems. Current challenges for disturbance modelling in forest ecosystems are thus (i) to overcome remaining limits in process understanding, (ii) to further a mechanistic foundation in disturbance modelling, (iii) to integrate multiple disturbance processes in dynamic ecosystem models for decision support in forest management, and (iv) to bring together scaling capabilities across several levels of organization with a representation of system complexity that captures the emergent behaviour of disturbance regimes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The outbreaks of Ips typographus (L.) in Central Europe after severe storms in the 1990s triggered extensive research. Molecular techniques were used to analyze the relations and origins of European Ips species. The biological characteristics of I. typographus such as the influence of temperature on life history parameters and flight behavior have been analyzed in detail. The spruce bark beetle was found to disperse well beyond 500 m. However, new attacks mostly occurred in the vicinity of old ones. Many studies refer to invertebrate natural enemies of I. typographus such as predatory beetles and flies as well as various parasitoids. While the species assemblages of antagonists have been extensively investigated their dynamics and impact on I. typographus populations are controversial. The susceptibility and defense mechanisms of host trees are crucial for a successful attack by bark beetles. Newly attacked trees respond with preformed resin, local wound reactions and eventually with systemic changes in their physiology. Risk assessments have been performed at both tree and stand level. Risk of attack seems to be mainly related to the exposition, age, and nutrient and water supply of the trees. The dynamics of outbreaks largely depends on insect abundance, tree susceptibility, weather conditions, and human measures. This renders predictions difficult. Various control techniques are reviewed and the need for more sophisticated risk assessment tools is stressed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Plantations of maritime pines near Landes, France range in age from 8 to 46 years with aboveground biomass between 5 and 105 tons/ha. Loblolly pine stands established on abandoned agricultural fields near Duke, NC range in age from 4 to 90 years and extend the range of aboveground biomass to 560 tons/ha for the older stands. These two experimental forests are largely complementary with respect to biomass. Radar backscatter is found to increase approximately linearly with increasing biomass until it saturates at a biomass level that depends on the radar frequency. The biomass saturation level is about 200 tons/ha at P-band and 100 tons/ha at L-band, and the C-band backscattering coefficient shows much less sensitivity to total aboveground biomass},

abstract = {Storm events are capable of causing windthrow to large forest areas. A rapid detection of the spatial distribution of the windthrown areas is crucial for forest managers to help them direct their limited resources. Since synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is acquired largely independent of daylight or weather conditions, SAR sensors can produce temporally consistent and reliable data with a high revisit rate. In the present study, a straightforward approach was developed that uses Sentinel-1 (S-1) C-band VV and VH polarisation data for a rapid windthrow detection in mixed temperate forests for two study areas in Switzerland and northern Germany. First, several S-1 acquisitions of approximately 10 before and 30 days after the storm event were radiometrically terrain corrected. Second, based on these S-1 acquisitions, a SAR composite image of before and after the storm was generated. Subsequently, after analysing the differences in backscatter between before and after the storm within windthrown and intact forest areas, a change detection method was developed to suggest potential locations of windthrown areas of a minimum extent of 0.5 ha-as is required by the forest management. The detection is based on two user-defined parameters. While the results from the independent study area in Germany indicated that the method is very promising for detecting areal windthrow with a producer's accuracy of 0.88, its performance was less satisfactory at detecting scattered windthrown trees. Moreover, the rate of false positives was low, with a user's accuracy of 0.85 for (combined) areal and scattered windthrown areas. These results underscore that C-band backscatter data have great potential to rapidly detect the locations of windthrow in mixed temperate forests within a short time (approx. two weeks) after a storm event. Furthermore, the two adjustable parameters allow a flexible application of the method tailored to the user's needs.},

This technology can be efficient in carrying out small-area inspections of anomalous reflectance characteristics of trees at a very high level of detail. Increased frequency and intensity of insect induced forest disturbance has established a new demand for effective methods suitable in mapping and monitoring tasks. In this investigation, a novel miniaturized hyperspectral frame imaging sensor operating in the wavelength range of 500-900 nm was used to identify mature Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) trees suffering from infestation, representing a different outbreak phase, by the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.). We developed a new processing method for analyzing spectral characteristic for high spatial resolution photogrammetric and hyperspectral images in forested environments, as well as for identifying individual anomalous trees. The dense point clouds, measured using image matching, enabled detection of single trees with an accuracy of 74.7{\%}. We classified the trees into classes of healthy, infested and dead, and the results were promising. The best results for the overall accuracy were 76{\%} (Cohen's kappa 0.60), when using three color classes (healthy, infested, dead). For two color classes (healthy, dead), the best overall accuracy was 90{\%} (kappa 0.80).

The objectives of this study were to develop and test a new index, based on red, green and blue bands, that is sensitive to differences in leaf chlorophyll content at leaf and canopy scales. We propose the triangular greenness index (TGI), which calculates the area of a triangle with vertices: ($\lambda$r, Rr), ($\lambda$g, Rg), and ($\lambda$b, Rb), where $\lambda$ is the wavelength (nm) and R is the reflectance for bands in red (r), green (g), and blue (b) wavelengths. The TGI was correlated with chlorophyll content using a variety of leaf and plot reflectance data. Generally, indices using the chlorophyll red-edge (710-730 nm) had higher correlations with chlorophyll content compared to TGI. However, correlations between TGI and chlorophyll content were equal to or higher than broad-band indices, when leaf area index (LAI) was {\textgreater}2. Simulations using the Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL) canopy model indicate an interaction among TGI, LAI, and soil type at low LAI, whereas at high LAI, TGI was only affected by leaf chlorophyll content. The TGI could be used with low-cost sensors, such as commercially-available digital cameras, for N management by remote sensing. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the American Society of Agronomy.

abstract = {Natural disturbances induced by insect outbreaks have increased in forest ecosystems over the past decades. To minimize economic loss and prevent a mass outbreak, early detection of bark beetle green attack – a period when trees have yet to show visual signs of infestation stress – is therefore crucial to effective and timely forest management. In this study, we evaluated the ability of spectral vegetation indices extracted from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery to map bark beetle green attack using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square discriminate analysis (PLS-DA). A recent infestation map produced through visual interpretation of high-resolution aerial photographs validated the final infestation output maps. Leaf spectral measurements alongside total chlorophyll and nitrogen concentration, leaf water content and leaf dry matter content were measured to assess the impact of bark beetle green attack on foliar properties. We observed that the majority of spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) calculated from Sentinel-2, particularly red-edge dependent indices (NDRE 2 and 3) and water-related indices (SR-SWIR, NDWI, DSWI and LWCI), were able to discriminate healthy from infested plots. In contrast, only the water-related indices (NDWI, DSWI and RDI) from Landsat-8 were able to discriminate between healthy and infested plots efficiently. The total number of pixels identified as harboring a green attack that matched with ground truth data (aerial photography) was higher for Sentinel-2 (67{\%}) than for Landsat-8 (36{\%}) SVIs, indicating the elevated sensitivity of Sentinel-2 imagery to changes induced by bark beetle green attack. We also determined that foliar chlorophyll and leaf water content were significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.05) in healthy trees than in green-attacked trees. Our study highlights the potential of Sentinel-2 data for the early detection of bark beetle infestations and the production of reliable infestation maps at the green-attack stage.},

abstract = {Natural disturbances like wildfire, windthrow and insect outbreaks are critical drivers of composition, structure and functioning of forest ecosystems. They are strongly climate-sensitive, and are thus likely to be distinctly affected by climatic changes. Observations across Europe show that in recent decades, forest disturbance regimes have intensified markedly, resulting in a strong increase in damage from wind, bark beetles and wildfires. Climate change is frequently hypothesized as the main driving force behind this intensification, but changes in forest structure and composition associated with management activities such as promoting conifers and increasing standing timber volume (i.e. 'forest change') also strongly influence susceptibility to disturbances. Here, we show that from 1958 to 2001, forest change contributed in the same order of magnitude as climate change to the increase in disturbance damage in Europe's forests. Climate change was the main driver of the increase in area burnt, while changes in forest extent, structure and composition particularly affected the variation in wind and bark beetle damage. For all three disturbance agents, damage was most severe when conducive weather conditions and increased forest susceptibility coincided. We conclude that a continuing trend towards more disturbance-prone conditions is likely for large parts of Europe's forests, and can have strong detrimental effects on forest carbon storage and other ecosystem services. Understanding the interacting drivers of natural disturbance regimes is thus a prerequisite for climate change mitigation and adaptation in forest ecosystem management. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Thus, the optimization of nitrogen fertilization has become the object of intense research due to its environmental and economic impact. This article focuses on reviewing current methods and techniques used to determine plant N status. Kjeldahl digestion and Dumas combustion have been used as reference methods for N determination in plants, but they are destructive and time consuming. By using spectroradiometers, reflectometers, imagery from satellite sensors and digital cameras, optical properties have been measured to estimate N in plants, such as crop canopy reflectance, leaf transmittance, chlorophyll and polyphenol fluorescence. High correlation has been found between optical parameters and plant N status, and those techniques are not destructive. However, some drawbacks include chlorophyll saturation, atmospheric and soil interference, and the high cost of instruments. Electrical properties of plant tissue have been used to estimate quality in fruits, and water content in plants, as well as nutrient deficiency, which suggests that they have potential for use in plant N determination. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {The spruce bark beetle Ips typographus is the major tree-killing bark beetle in Eurasia. To increase knowledge about its seasonal flight patterns and about the thermal sums required for emergence, a study was conducted in southern Sweden from 2006 to 2010. Seasonal flight patterns were recorded by pheromone traps and development was recorded by felling trees three times during each season. Flight began, on average, on 27 April [after 47degree-days (dd){\textgreater}5°C]. More than 50{\%} of flight activity occurred after mid-June, and this continued to mid-August. Re-emergence of parental beetles after they had produced the first brood started, on average, on 24 May (after 122dd). Continued flight and oviposition demonstrated that sister broods were frequent. A higher proportion of parental beetles re-emerged from trees colonized in May (95{\%}) than in July (20{\%}). Beetles that colonized trees late had to accumulate a higher thermal sum before re-emerging (400dd). Filial beetles began to emerge, on average, on 29 June (after 437dd) and started to fly in early July, giving rise to at least a partial second generation in each year. A higher proportion of filial beetles had emerged from trees colonized in May (75{\%}) than in July (15{\%}). Knowledge of these region-specific flight patterns and the associated thermal sums required for emergence will facilitate efficient pest management by enabling timely removal of fallen and standing weakened host trees. The obtained data will also be useful for improving models that predict the population dynamics in a warmer climate. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Royal Entomological Society.},

abstract = {With the development of satellite and remote sensing techniques, more and more image data from airborne/satellite sensors have become available. Multi-sensor image fusion seeks to combine information from different images to obtain more inferences than can be derived from a single sensor. In image-based application fields, image fusion has emerged as a promising research area since the end of the last century. The paper presents an overview of recent advances in multi-sensor satellite image fusion. Firstly, the most popular existing fusion algorithms are introduced, with emphasis on their recent improvements. Advances in main applications fields in remote sensing, including object identification, classification, change detection and maneuvering targets tracking, are described. Both advantages and limitations of those applications are then discussed. Recommendations are addressed, including: (1) Improvements of fusion algorithms; (2) Development of "algorithm fusion" methods; (3) Establishment of an automatic quality assessment scheme. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the authors.},

abstract = {In this study, we quantify the effect of uncertainties in climate projections on an impact model (IPS) that describes the temperature-dependent swarming and development of Ips typographus. Three forcing climate data sets (ensembles) were used: (1) E-Obs gridded observations, (2) ERA-40 reanalysis data downscaled by eight regional climate models (RCMs) and (3) regional scenarios from one RCM forced by seven GCM simulations representing SRES-A1B, for the period of 1961-2097. The IPS{\_}RCM{\_}ERA40 ensemble members, including IPS{\_}RC3{\_}ERA40, were generally within the IPS{\_}E-Obs confidence limits. The IPS model is however sensitive to the warming during spring and cooling during autumn, and deviations in simulated swarming were related to known climate model biases. The variation between the IPS{\_}RCA3{\_}GCM ensemble members was particularly high in regions where warmer summers (temperature increase from +2 °C to +4 °C) will induce an additional generation per year, for example a shift from one to two generations per year in south Scandinavia, and an increased frequency of three generations per year in central Europe. Impact assessments based on an ensemble of climate data gives more robust decision support than a single climate model approach because it allows a probabilistic assessment of the geographical areas experiencing a transition in biological response. {\textcopyright}2010 The Authors Tellus A{\textcopyright}2010 International Meteorological Institute in Stockholm.},

abstract = {A Modified Simple Ratio (MSR) Is proposed for retrieving biophysical parameters of boreal forests using remote sensing data. This vegetation index is formulated based on an evaluation of several two-band vegetation indices, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Simple Ratio (SR), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Indices (SAVI, SAVI1, SAVI2), Weighted Difference Vegetation Index (WDVI), Global Environment Monitoring Index (GEMI), Non-Linear Index (NLI), and Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI). MSR is an improved version of RDVI for the purpose of linearizing their relationships with biophysical parameters. All indices were obtained from Landsat-5 TM band 3 (visible) and band 4 (near infrared) images after atmospheric corrections (except for GEMI) and were correlated with ground-based measurements made in 20 Jack Pine (Pinus banksiana) and Black Spruce (Picea mariana) stands during the BOREAS field experiment in 1994. The measurements include Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) absorbed by the forest canopies. Among these vegetation indices, SR, MSR, and NDVI were found to be best correlated with LAI and FPAR in both spring and summer. All other indices performed poorly. Both NDVI and MSR can be expressed as a function of SR.Measurement errors in remote sensing data often occur due to changes in solar zenith angle, subpixel contamination of clouds, or dissimilar surface features and the variation in the local topography and other environmental factors. These errors generally cause simultaneous increases or decreases in the red and near infrared reflectances, and their effects can be greatly reduced by taking the ratio. All other indices involving mathematical operations other than ratioing could retain the errors or even amplify them.The major problem in using the vegetation indices obtained from red and near infrared bands is the small sensitivity to the overstorey vegetation conditions. Although many of the vegetation indices such as SAVI, SAVI1, and SAVI2 are developed to minimize the effect of the background on retrieving the vegetation information, they also reduce their sensitivity to the changes in the overstorey conditions. {\textcopyright} 1996 Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing/Journal canadien de t{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}d{\'{e}}tection.},

abstract = {A synergic integration of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical time series offers an unprecedented opportunity in vegetation phenology monitoring for mountain agriculture management. In this paper, we performed a correlation analysis of radar signal to vegetation and soil conditions by using a time series of Sentinel-1 C-band dual-polarized (VV and VH) SAR images acquired in the South Tyrol region (Italy) from October 2014 to September 2016. Together with Sentinel-1 images, we exploited corresponding Sentinel-2 images and ground measurements. Results show that Sentinel-1 cross-polarized VH backscattering coefficients have a strong vegetation contribution and are well correlated with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values retrieved from optical sensors, thus allowing the extraction of meadow phenological phases. Particularly for the Start Of Season (SOS) at low altitudes, the mean difference in days between Sentinel-1 and ground sensors is compatible with the acquisition time of the SAR sensor. However, the results show a decrease in accuracy with increasing altitude. The same trend is observed for senescence. The main outcomes of our investigations in terms of inter-satellite comparison show that Sentinel-1 is less effective than Sentinel-2 in detecting the SOS. At the same time, Sentinel-1 is as robust as Sentinel-2 in defining mowing events. Our study shows that SAR-Optical data integration is a promising approach for phenology detection in mountain regions.},

abstract = {SAR data are almost independent from weather conditions, and thus are well suited for mapping of seasonally changing variables such as land cover. In regard to recent and upcoming missions, multitemporal and multi-frequency approaches become even more attractive. In the present study, classifier ensembles (i.e., boosted decision tree and random forests) are applied to multi-temporal C-band SAR data, from different study sites and years. A detailed accuracy assessment shows that classifier ensembles, in particularly random forests, outperform standard approaches like a single decision tree and a conventional maximum likelihood classifier by more than 10{\%} independently from the site and year. They reach up to almost 84{\%} of overall accuracy in rural areas with large plots. Visual interpretation confirms the statistical accuracy assessment and reveals that also typical random noise is considerably reduced. In addition the results demonstrate that random forests are less sensitive to the number of training samples and perform well even with only a small number. Random forests are computationally highly efficient and are hence considered very well suited for land cover classifications of future multifrequency and multitemporal stacks of SAR imagery. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Natural disturbances such as bark beetle infestations, feeding of vertebrates, storm throw, or snow breakage constitute important determinants for decision-making processes in forest management. Knowledge concerning the mechanisms of disturbance agents and the spatial distribution of predisposed stands allows for both an optimized input of labor and financial resources in forest management and may support the definition of core areas and surrounding buffer zones in protected areas. In order to face the demand for tools that illuminate the complex causal relationships between disturbance agents and predisposing site and stand-related characteristics, knowledge-based expert models for hazard assessment were developed. Key factors for the predisposition of forests to diverse biotic and abiotic agents were identified by an extensive literature research and expert discussions, and summarized by way of checklists. We discuss the basic assumptions of our predisposition assessment systems (PAS), using the specific model for the eight-toothed spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) and the results of the system's application and verification in the High Tatra Mountains. We demonstrate that the spatial distribution of predisposing indicators significantly corresponds to the pattern of bark beetle attacks in the research area. The assessment system offers high flexibility of the underlying database and for spatial resolution, allows for a retrospective analysis of forest damages, for various possibilities of application (e.g., as a checklist, spatial analysis, etc.), and for easy incorporation of new scientific findings and empiric knowledge. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Biome-scale disturbances by eruptive herbivores provide valuable insights into species interactions, ecosystemfunction, and impacts of global change. We present a conceptual framework using one system as a model, emphasizing interactions across levels of biological hierarchy and spatiotemporal scales. Bark beetles are major natural disturbance agents in western North American forests. However, recent bark beetle population eruptions have exceeded the frequencies, impacts, and ranges documented during the previous 125 years. Extensive host abundance and susceptibility, concentrated beetle density, favorable weather, optimal symbiotic associations, and escape from natural enemies must occur jointly for beetles to surpass a series of thresholds and exert widespread disturbance. Opposing feedbacks determine qualitatively distinct outcomes at junctures at the biochemical through landscape levels. Eruptions occur when key thresholds are surpassed, prior constraints cease to exert influence, and positive feedbacks amplify across scales. These dynamics are bidirectional, as landscape features influence how lower-scale processes are amplified or buffered. Climate change and reduced habitat heterogeneity increase the likelihood that key thresholds will be exceeded, and may cause fundamental regime shifts. Systems in which endogenous feedbacks can dominate after external forces foster the initial breach of thresholds appear particularly sensitive to anthropogenic perturbations. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Biological Sciences.},

The objective of this research is to test Sentinel-1 SAR multitemporal data, supported by multispectral and SAR data at other wavelengths, for fine-scale mapping of above-ground biomass (AGB) at the provincial level in a Mediterranean forested landscape. The regression results indicate good accuracy of prediction (R2=0.7) using integrated sensors when an upper bound of 400Mg ha-1 is used in modeling. Multitemporal SAR information was relevant, allowing the selection of optimal Sentinel-1 data, as broadleaf forests showed a different response in backscatter throughout the year. Similar accuracy in predictions was obtained when using SAR multifrequency data or joint SAR and optical data. Predictions based on SAR data were more conservative, and in line with those from an independent sample from the National Forest Inventory, than those based on joint data types. The potential of S1 data in predicting AGB can possibly be improved if models are developed per specific groups (deciduous or evergreen species) or forest types and using a larger range of ground data. Overall, this research shows the usefulness of Sentinel-1 data to map biomass at very high resolution for local study and at considerable carbon density.},

abstract = {Bark beetles cause widespread damages in the coniferous-dominated forests of central Europe and North America. In the future, areas affected by bark beetles may further increase due to climate change. However, the early detection of the bark beetle green attack can guide management decisions to prevent larger damages. For this reason, a field-based bark beetle monitoring program is currently implemented in Germany. The combination of remote sensing and field data may help minimizing the reaction time and reducing costs of monitoring programs covering large forested areas. In this case study, RapidEye and TerraSAR-X data were analyzed separately and in combination to detect bark beetle green attack. The remote sensing data were acquired in May 2009 for a study site in south-west Germany. In order to distinguish healthy areas and areas affected by bark beetle green attack, three statistical approaches were compared: generalized linear models (GLM), maximum entropy (ME) and random forest (RF). The spatial scale (minimum mapping unit) was 78.5 m2. TerraSAR-X data resulted in fair classification accuracy with a cross-validated Cohen's Kappa Coefficient (kappa) of 0.23. RapidEye data resulted in moderate classification accuracy with a kappa of 0.51. The highest classification accuracy was obtained by combining the TerraSAR-X and RapidEye data, resulting in a kappa of 0.74. The accuracy of ME models was considerably higher than the accuracy of GLM and RF models. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The hyperspectral narrowband data was acquired over 395 to 1010 nanometers using a 1.43-nanometer-wide, 430 bands, hand-held spectroradiometer. Broadband data were derived using a Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper image acquired to correspond with field spectroradiometer and ground-truth measurements. Spectral and biophysical data were obtained from 196 sample locations, including farms and rangelands. Six representative crops grown during the main cropping season were selected: barley, wheat, lentil, cumin, chickpea, and vetch. Biophysical variables consisted of leaf area index, wet biomass, dry biomass, plant height, plant nitrogen, and canopy cover. Narrowband and broadband vegetation indices were computed and their relationship with quantitative crop characteristics were established and compared. The simple narrowband two-band vegetation indices (TBVI) and the optimum multiple-band vegetation indices (OMBVI) models provided the best results. The narrowband TBVI and OMBVI models are compared with six other categories of narrow and broadband indices. Compared to the best broadband TM indices, TBVI explained up to 24 percent greater variability and OMBVI explained up to 27 percent greater variability in estimating different crop variables. A Predominant proportion of crop characteristics are best estimated using data from four narrowbands, in order of importance, centered around 675 nanometers (red absorption maxima), 905 nm (near-infrared reflection peak), 720 nm (mid portion of the red-edge), and 550 nm (green reflectance maxima). The study determined 12 spectral bands and their bandwidths (Table 5) that provide optimal agricultural crop characteristics in the visible and near-infrared portion of the spectrum.},

To monitor spatial and temporal dynamic forest stress conditions, timely, accurate, and cost-effective information is needed that could be provided by remote sensing. Recently, satellite imagery has become available via the RapidEye satellite constellation to provide spectral information in five broad bands, including the red-edge region (690-730. nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. We tested the hypothesis that broadband, red-edge satellite information improves early detection of stress (as manifest by shifts in foliar chlorophyll a. +. b) in a woodland ecosystem relative to other more commonly utilized band combinations of red, green, blue, and near infrared band reflectance spectra. We analyzed a temporally dense time series of 22 RapidEye scenes of a pi{\~{n}}on-juniper woodland in central New Mexico acquired before and after stress was induced by girdling. We found that the Normalized Difference Red-Edge index (NDRE) allowed stress to be detected 13. days after girdling - between and 16. days earlier than broadband spectral indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green NDVI traditionally used for satellite based forest health monitoring. We conclude that red-edge information has the potential to considerably improve forest stress monitoring from satellites and warrants further investigation in other forested ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Leaf nitrogen content has so far been quantified through empirical techniques using hyperspectral remote sensing. However, it remains a challenge to estimate the nitrogen content in fresh leaves through inversion of physically based models. Leaf nitrogen has been found to correlate with leaf traits (e.g., leaf chlorophyll, dry matter, and water) well through links to the photosynthetic process, which provides potential to estimate nitrogen indirectly. We therefore set out to estimate leaf nitrogen content by using its links to leaf traits that could be retrieved from a physically based model (PROSPECT) inversion. Leaf optical (directional-hemispherical reflectance and transmittance between 350 and 2500 nm) and leaf biochemical (nitrogen, chlorophyll, dry matter, and water) properties were measured. Correlation analysis showed that the area-based nitrogen correlations with leaf traits were higher than mass-based correlations. Hence, simple and multiple linear regression models were established for area-based nitrogen using three leaf traits (leaf chlorophyll content, leaf mass per area, and equivalent water thickness). In addition, the traits were retrieved by the inversion of PROSPECT using an iterative optimization algorithm. The established empirical models and the leaf traits retrieved from PROSPECT were used to estimate leaf nitrogen content. A simple linear regression model using only retrieved equivalent water thickness as a predictor produced the most accurate estimation of nitrogen R2 = 0.58, normalized RMSE = 0.11. The combination of empirical and physically based models provides a moderately accurate estimation of leaf nitrogen content, which can be transferred to other datasets in a robust and upscalable manner.},

abstract = {Context: Growing evidence suggests that climate change could substantially alter forest disturbances. Interactions between individual disturbance agents are a major component of disturbance regimes, yet how interactions contribute to their climate sensitivity remains largely unknown. Objectives: Here, our aim was to assess the climate sensitivity of disturbance interactions, focusing on wind and bark beetle disturbances. Methods: We developed a process-based model of bark beetle disturbance, integrated into the dynamic forest landscape model iLand (already including a detailed model of wind disturbance). We evaluated the integrated model against observations from three wind events and a subsequent bark beetle outbreak, affecting 530.2 ha (3.8 {\%}) of a mountain forest landscape in Austria between 2007 and 2014. Subsequently, we conducted a factorial experiment determining the effect of changes in climate variables on the area disturbed by wind and bark beetles separately and in combination. Results: iLand was well able to reproduce observations with regard to area, temporal sequence, and spatial pattern of disturbance. The observed disturbance dynamics was strongly driven by interactions, with 64.3 {\%} of the area disturbed attributed to interaction effects. A +4 °C warming increased the disturbed area by +264.7 {\%} and the area-weighted mean patch size by +1794.3 {\%}. Interactions were found to have a ten times higher sensitivity to temperature changes than main effects, considerably amplifying the climate sensitivity of the disturbance regime. Conclusions: Disturbance interactions are a key component of the forest disturbance regime. Neglecting interaction effects can lead to a substantial underestimation of the climate change sensitivity of disturbance regimes.},

abstract = {Automatic identification of forest patches disturbed by the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus L. is crucial to reveal the rules of following bark beetle outbreaks on the landscape scale. Landsat imagery provides free resources to outline past and present gradations of bark beetle out- breaks (BBOs). The objective of this study is to identify the most sensitive vegetation index through different method of vegetation index differencing to identify past and actual bark beetle outbreaks. Six Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images, from 2005-2009 and 2011, were converted into selected vegetation indices (VIs) sensitive to conifer tree health in a Norway spruce-dominated forest in the High Tatra Mountains. The Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Moisture Stress Index (MSI), Normalised Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Disturbance Index (DI) and Changed Disturbance Index (DI´) were calculated separately for every year, and the methodology of vegetation index differencing was applied to multiple two-year time periods (2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008, 2008-2009 and 2010-2011), thus producing the Changed Vegetation Index ($\Delta$VI). A set of thresholds was established on $\Delta$VI to classify disturbed and undisturbed forest due to BBOs; the sensitivity of different VIs to identify BBO was equally evaluated. The highest accuracies of classifications were reached in 2007 and 2011 (kappa index of agreement {\textgreater}70{\%} and {\textgreater}40{\%}, respectively), which were characterised by an epidemic phase of a BBO. All selected VIs were highly sensitive to BBOs, except for NDVI. The stable threshold value for change detection is not widely applicable to detect past forest disturbances caused by bark beetles, however. Finally, for further research of the epidemic phases of BBOs, we recommend the utilisation of the vegetation indices VCI, MSI and NDMI to detect BBOs because of their simplicity and easy interpretability.},

abstract = {A ground-based X-band radar directed almost horizontally into the top of a mature ash during 5 months. The aim was to relate radar backscatter to hydrologic properties of leaves. The results show that: (1) Due to the retention of rain on the surface of leaves, the backscatter increased temporarily during and after showers. (2) The backscatter decreased the first days after a shower. This decrease is attributed to depletion of internal water-storage tissues. (3) The backscatter increases towards the end of the season. This trend is related to a decreased transpiration rate and increased water content of leaves.},

abstract = {Biomass and leaf area index (LAI) are important variables in many ecological and environmental applications. In this study, the suitability of visible to shortwave infrared advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) data for estimating aboveground tree and LAI in the treeline mountain birch forests was tested in northernmost Finland. The biomass and LAI of the 128 plots were surveyed, and the empirical relationships between forest variables and ASTER data were studied using correlation analysis and linear and non-linear regression analysis. The studied spectral features also included several spectral vegetation indices (SVI) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) transformed reflectances. The results indicate significant relationships between the biomass, LAI and ASTER data. The variables were predicted most accurately by CCA transformed reflectances, the approach corresponding to the multiple regression analysis. The lowest RMSEs were 3.45 t ha-1 (41.0{\%}) and 0.28 m2m-2 (37.0{\%}) for biomass and LAI respectively. The red band was the band with the strongest correlation against the biomass and LAI. SR and NDVI were the SVIs with the strongest linear and non-linear relationships. Although the best models explained about 85{\%} of the variation in biomass and LAI, the undergrowth vegetation and background reflectance are likely to affect the observed relationships. {\textcopyright} 2006 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre- lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna- tional conference, ∗∗∗, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {Bush encroachment is a highly relevant environmental issue in South African savannas, influencing ecological processes as well as the grazing capacity of the land. However the drivers of bush encroachment are not yet fully revealed which can partly be attributed to the problem that large-scale data of woody vegetation cover are missing. Using a multi-scale and a multi-sensor approach, this study aimed at providing the status of woody vegetation cover for the Molopo Area in South Africa. Training data for woody vegetation was derived from unsupervised classification of high-resolution aerial image tiles. To derive spatially continuous estimates of fractional woody cover for the entire Molopo Area, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data were applied in a machine learning based modelling approach. Therefore, a database of training samples was generated by aggregating the classified aerial image tiles to the geometry of the Sentinel data. A Random Forest algorithm with a forward feature variable selection was then trained to relate the spectral and radar information to fractional woody cover. The model was applied to make spatial predictions of fractional woody cover at 10 m resolution for the entire Molopo Area for the year 2016. Spatial cross-validation revealed a prediction error in fractional cover of 12{\%}. The derived model and cover data show the potential for upcoming time series analysis of Sentinel-based woody cover estimates which can serve as a basis to bring new insights into the drivers of bush encroachment.},

abstract = {Enabling intercomparison of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery acquired from different sensors or acquisition modes requires accurate modeling of not only the geometry of each scene, but also of systematic influences on the radiometry of individual scenes. Terrain variations affect not only the position of a given point on the Earth's surface but also the brightness of the radar return as expressed in radar geometry. Without treatment, the hill-slope modulations of the radiometry threaten to overwhelm weaker thematic land cover induced backscatter differences, and comparison of backscatter from multiple satellites, modes, or tracks loses meaning. The ASAR {\&} PALSAR sensors provide state vectors and timing with higher absolute accuracy than was previously available, allowing them to directly support accurate tie-point-free geolocation and radiometric normalization of their imagery. Given accurate knowledge of the acquisition geometry of a SAR image together with a digital height model (DHM) of the area imaged, radiometric image simulation is applied to estimate the local illuminated area for each point in the image. Ellipsoid-based or sigma naught ($\sigma$0) based incident angle approximations that fail to reproduce the effect of topographic variation in their sensor model are contrasted with a new method that integrates terrain variations with the concept of gamma naught ($\gamma$0) backscatter, converting directly from beta naught ($\beta$0) to a newly introduced terrain-flattened $\gamma$0 normalization convention. The interpretability of imagery treated in this manner is improved in comparison to processing based on conventional ellipsoid or local incident angle based $\sigma$0 normalization. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},
